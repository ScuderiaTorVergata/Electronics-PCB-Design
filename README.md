# Electronics-PCB-Design
Owned by Scuderia Tor Vergata

In this repository will be uploaded all projects concerning the design of electronic boards used on our racing prototype.

Every single PCB will have a detailed project card with description and 3D render.

We are proud to say that every one of our PCBs is produced by JLCPCB which helps us in the realization of our projects.
You will find more information about how they support us in the single project boards.

You can find them all in the Wiki tab.
